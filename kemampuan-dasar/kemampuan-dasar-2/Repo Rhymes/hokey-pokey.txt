Everybody form a circle
Put your left foot in
Your left foot out
Your left foot in
And shake it all about
You do the hokey pokey
And turn yourself around
Now put your right foot in
Your right foot out
Right foot in
Then you shake it all about
And then you do the hokey pokey
Turn yourself around
That's what it's all about
You put your head in
You put your head out
Put your head in
And bang it all about
Do the hokey pokey
And turn yourself around
That's what it's all about
Let's do the hokey pokey!

That's what it's all about
Put your right hand in
Your right hand out

And shake it all about
You do the hokey pokey
And you turn yourself around
Now put your tongue in
And your tongue out
Tongue in
And blblblblbl!
You do the hokey pokey
Turn yourself around
That's what it's all about
You put your bottom in
